\textit{(This section is also part of the readme.md on the weekme-github repository)} \\
\\Using \textbf{WeekMe} you can plan your next week. Not more, not less. No bloated UI nor functions you will probably never use anyway. 
How does this \textbf{awesome application} work? Hopefully it's so intuitive that any explanation is unnecessary but just in case here we give you a short introduction.

\subsection{Account}
Like in most web apps you can sign up for an account, log in and out as well as change your password and email. And of course there is also a solution in case you forget your password.
